RWD 
responsive web design
1.bootstrap will adjust components based on the screen size

1.layout
2.Grid system

Layout Examples:-

Mobile <576px
Mobile large screen >= 576px
Tablets >= 768px
Laptaps>=992px
Destop/Projectors>= 1200px

Grid system works on 12 columns system i.e need call the col between 12 only
like 
col-sm-2
col-md-8
col-sm-2


These column should be called inside a row.

whenever we call a row a column should also be called accordingly.
we cant call row inside a row & column inside a column.

                 <576px        ≥576px      ≥768px     ≥992px     ≥1200px
.container       	100%	       540px	     720px	     960px	     1140px

operators

1.Arithmetic operators = used for mathemtical calculation

    operator |   description   |  example  |result
a.     +       Addition            5+3 = 8
b.     -       subraction          5-3 = 2
c.     *      Multipication        5*3 = 15
d.     /        division           5/2 = 2.5
e.     %     modulus (remainder)   5%2 = 1
f.     **     Exponentiation       5**2 = 25 
g.     ++       Increment          let x =5;x++6
h.     --       decrement          let x =5;x--4


2.Assignment Operators=used to assign values to variables.

    operator |   description   |  example  |result
a.     = Assignment x=10
b.     += Add and Assign x += 5 x=x+5
c.     -= subtract and assign
d.     *= Multiply and Assign
e.    /= Divide and assign
f. %=  modulus and assign
g. **= Exponentiation assign


3. Comparison Operator = used to compare two values.

    operator |   description   |  example  |result
a.(==). Equal to 5    =="5" true
b. (===). strict equal
c. ===    (type+value)      5==="5" false
d. !=  NOT equal           5!="5"   false
e. !==   strict not equal  5!=="5".  true
f. >     Greater then         5>3     true
g. <      less then           5<3     false
h. >=     Greater then equal     5>=3   true
i. <=        less then equal    5<=3     false


4. Logical operators = used for logical operation

    operator |   description   |  example  
a.    &&          logical          AND
b.    '           logical          OR
c.    !           logical          NOT


5. string Operators = used to manipulation strings.

    operator |   description   |  example      | result
a. + string Concatenation        "hello"+"World"
b. +=.    Concatenation assign   let

Git basic Commands

1. git status
to check the status of the local changes

2. git add
to add all the files in the local changes

3. git commit -m "message"

4. git log
to view the commit history

5. git branch
to view the branches

6. git branch -a
to view all the branches

7. git checkout branch-name
to switch to a branch

8. git merge branch-name
to merge a branch

9. git push origin branch-name
to push the change to the remote repository

10. git pull origin branch-name
to pull the changes from the remote repository

11. git remote -v
to view the remote repository


when a new repo is created to push the code into it

1. to initailize .get into the project 
git init

2. to add a readme file into the git
git add README. md

3. to add all the files in the current directory
git add.

4. to commit all the changed into the git
git commit -m "first commit"
